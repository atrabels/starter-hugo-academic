The learning task is geared towards the automatic detection and clustering of these expressions according to the latent topics they confer and the embedded viewpoints they voice. Experiments are conducted on three types of contentious documents: polls, online debates and editorials. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the models output confirm the ability of JTV in handling different types of contentious issues. Moreover, analysis of the preliminary experimental results shows the ability of the proposed model to automatically and accurately detect recurrent patterns of arguing expressions.",

abstract = {This work proposes an unsupervised method intended to enhance the quality of opinion mining in contentious text. It presents a Joint Topic Viewpoint (JTV) probabilistic model to analyze the underlying divergent arguing expressions that may be present in a collection of contentious documents. The conceived JTV has the potential of automatically carrying the tasks of extracting associated terms denoting an arguing expression, according to the hidden topics it discusses and the embedded viewpoint it voices. Furthermore, JTV's structure enables the unsupervised grouping of obtained arguing expressions according to their viewpoints, using a proposed constrained clustering algorithm which is an adapted version of the constrained k-means clustering (COP-KMEANS). Experiments are conducted on three types of contentious documents (polls, online debates and editorials), through six different contentious data sets. Quantitative evaluations of the topic modeling output, as well as the constrained clustering results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to fit the data and generate distinctive patterns of arguing expressions. Moreover, it empirically demonstrates a better clustering of arguing expressions over state-of-the art and baseline methods. The qualitative analysis highlights the coherence of clustered arguing expressions of the same viewpoint and the divergence of opposing ones.}

They learn from collections of past responses and generate one based on a given utterance without considering, speech act, desired style or emotion to be expressed. In this research, we address the problem of forcing the dialogue generation to express emotion. We present three models that either concatenate the desired emotion with the source input during the learning, or push the emotion in the decoder. The results, evaluated with an emotion tagger, are encouraging with all three models, but present better outcome and promise with our model that adds the emotion vector in the decoder.",

  title={Unsupervised Model for Topic Viewpoint Discovery in Online Debates Leveraging Author Interactions}, volume={12}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15021}, abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; Online debate forums provide a valuable resource for textual discussions about controversial social and political issues. Discovering the viewpoints and their discourse or arguments from such resources is important for policy and decision makers. In order to detect the stance, most of the existing methods rely on expensively obtained human annotations and propose supervised solutions. In this work, we introduce a purely unsupervised Author Interaction Topic Viewpoint model (AITV) for viewpoint identification at the post and the discourse levels. The model favors &quot;heterophily&quot; over &quot;homophily&quot; when encoding the nature of the authors’ interactions in online debates. It assumes that the difference in viewpoints breeds interactions, unlike similar studies based on social network analysis, which hypothesize that similar viewpoints encourage interactions. We evaluate the model’s viewpoint identification and clustering accuracies at the author and post levels. Experiments are held on six corpora about four different controversial issues, extracted from two online debate forums. AITV’s results show a better performance in terms of viewpoint identification at the post level than the state-of-the-art supervised methods in terms of stance prediction, even though it is unsupervised. It also outperforms a recently proposed topic model for viewpoint discovery in social networks and achieves close results to a weakly guided unsupervised method in terms of author level viewpoint identification. Our results highlight the importance of encoding &quot;heterophily&quot; for purely unsupervised viewpoint identification in the context of online debates. We also carry out a brief qualitative evaluation of the discourse modeling in terms of Topic-Viewpoint word clusters. AITV shows encouraging results suggesting an accurate discovery of the viewpoints and topics’ discourses. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Trabelsi, Amine and Za{\"\i}ane, Osmar R.}, year={2018}, month={Jun.}

Self-attentional models have been used in the creation of the state-of-the-art models in many NLP task such as neural machine translation, but their usage has not been explored for the task of training end-to-end task-oriented dialogue generation systems yet. In this study, we apply these models on the DSTC2 dataset for training task-oriented chatbots. Our finding shows that self-attentional models can be exploited to create end-to-end task-oriented chatbots which not only achieve higher evaluation scores compared to recurrence-based models, but also do so more efficiently.",

However, editors on Wikipedia are only expected to link these mentions in order to help the reader to understand the content, but are discouraged from adding links that do not add any benefit for understanding an article. Therefore, many mentions of popular entities (such as countries or popular events in history), or previously linked articles, as well as the article{'}s entity itself, are not linked. In this paper, we discuss WEXEA, a Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation system, to create a text corpus based on Wikipedia with exhaustive annotations of entity mentions, i.e. linking all mentions of entities to their corresponding articles. This results in a huge potential for additional annotations that can be used for downstream NLP tasks, such as Relation Extraction. We show that our annotations are useful for creating distantly supervised datasets for this task. Furthermore, we publish all code necessary to derive a corpus from a raw Wikipedia dump, so that it can be reproduced by everyone.",

In order to generate more meaningful explanations, we propose UNION, a unified end-to-end framework, to utilize several existing commonsense datasets so that it allows a model to learn more dynamics under the scope of commonsense reasoning. In order to perform model selection efficiently, accurately, and promptly, we also propose a couple of auxiliary automatic evaluation metrics so that we can extensively compare the models from different perspectives. Our submitted system not only results in a good performance in the proposed metrics but also outperforms its competitors with the highest achieved score of 2.10 for human evaluation while remaining a BLEU score of 15.7.
