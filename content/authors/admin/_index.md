I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science at Université de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/informatique/), Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. My broad research interests relate to Artificial Intelligence, Applied Machine Leanrning, Data Mining and Natural Language Processing. I work on Unsupervised Automatic Contention Analysis and Summarization in Unstructured Text, Stance and Dubious Content Detection from Social Media, Emotion Recognition and Generation in Conversational Text.   

Prior to this position, I have been an Assistant Professor in the Deparment of Computer Science at [Lakehead University](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/programs/undergraduate-programs/computer-science) and a Postdoctoral Fellow of the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/)   in the [Computing Science Department at the University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html), Canada. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Alberta, under the supervision of [Prof. Osmar R. Zaïane](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/).
I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Montreal, Canada. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Management from the University of Tunis, Tunisia.

<span style="color:red">**For potential or current graduate students:**</span> I am currently looking for enthusiastic and motivated students interested in joining [Université de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/) thesis-based M.Sc. program and Ph.D. program in Computer Science under my supervision in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/informatique/). The targeted starting dates are January 2023, May 2023, or September 2023 (upon admission approval). 
 
The research focus will be on topics related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). These include Mining Anti-social Behaviour in Social Media, Emotion Recognition and Generation in Conversational Text, Stance Detection, and Argumentation Mining and Summarization.
 
Interested students can send me an email at “amine.trabelsi@usherbrooke.ca” with the subject “Supervision 2023”, and include: a CV, an unofficial transcript, a good reference letter (if possible) sent directly by the referee, and a cover letter describing why they are interested in the proposed research topics and NLP in general and how they match the expected profile.  

Applications by members of all underrepresented groups in computer science and post-secondary education are highly encouraged. 

<span style="color:red">P.S. Please note that prospective students might not receive a response to their email in case of a high volume of inquiries.</span> 

 
[comment]: <>  ({{ The student will be joining a recognized [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Master program](https://vectorinstitute.ai/aimasters/#vector-recognized-ai-masters-programs) by the world-renowned [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Moreover, the student admitted in Fall 2022 will have the possibility to be nominated by the department (based on an internal ranking) for the [Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/scholarship/). The scholarship is valued at C$17500 for one year. Note that some of Lakehead University’s internal deadlines apply for consideration for the scholarship. Hence, students are highly encouraged to apply to the program before the end of January 2022 and preferably in December 2021.}})
