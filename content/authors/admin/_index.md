I am currently an Assistant Professor at Lakehead University, Ontario. Previously, I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Computing Science Department at the University of Alberta, Canada.

My research interests relate to Artificial intelligence, Text and Data Mining, Automatic Contention Analysis, Topic Modeling, Opinion Mining, and Machine Learning.

I completed my Ph.D. in the Computing Science Department at the University of Alberta, under the supervision of Pr. Osmar R. Zaiane. I was a member of the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii).

I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Montreal, Canada, obtained in 2010. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Management in 2007 from the University of Tunis, Tunisia.
