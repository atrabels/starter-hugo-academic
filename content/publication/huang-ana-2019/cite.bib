 abstract = {This paper describes the system submitted by ANA Team for the SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext. We propose a novel Hierarchi- cal LSTMs for Contextual Emotion Detection (HRLCE) model. It classifies the emotion of an utterance given its conversational con- text. The results show that, in this task, our HRCLE outperforms the most recent state-of- the-art text classification framework: BERT. We combine the results generated by BERT and HRCLE to achieve an overall score of 0.7709 which ranked 5th on the final leader board of the competition among 165 Teams.},
