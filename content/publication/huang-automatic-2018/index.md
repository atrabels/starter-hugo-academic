abstract: Despite myriad efforts in the literature designing neural dialogue generation
  systems in recent years, very few consider putting restrictions on the response
  itself. They learn from collections of past responses and generate one based on
  a given utterance without considering, speech act, desired style or emotion to be
  expressed. In this research, we address the problem of forcing the dialogue generation
  to express emotion. We present three models that either concatenate the desired
  emotion with the source input during the learning, or push the emotion in the decoder.
  The results, evaluated with an emotion tagger, are encouraging with all three models,
  but present better outcome and promise with our model that adds the emotion vector
  in the decoder.
