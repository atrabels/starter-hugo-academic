abstract: This work proposes an unsupervised method intended to enhance the quality
  of opinion mining in contentious text. It presents a Joint Topic Viewpoint (JTV)
  probabilistic model to analyze the underlying divergent arguing expressions that
  may be present in a collection of contentious documents. The conceived JTV has the
  potential of automatically carrying the tasks of extracting associated terms denoting
  an arguing expression, according to the hidden topics it discusses and the embedded
  viewpoint it voices. Furthermore, JTV's structure enables the unsupervised grouping
  of obtained arguing expressions according to their viewpoints, using a proposed
  constrained clustering algorithm which is an adapted version of the constrained
  k-means clustering (COP-KMEANS). Experiments are conducted on three types of contentious
  documents (polls, online debates and editorials), through six different contentious
  data sets. Quantitative evaluations of the topic modeling output, as well as the
  constrained clustering results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to
  fit the data and generate distinctive patterns of arguing expressions. Moreover,
  it empirically demonstrates a better clustering of arguing expressions over state-of-the
  art and baseline methods. The qualitative analysis highlights the coherence of clustered
  arguing expressions of the same viewpoint and the divergence of opposing ones.
